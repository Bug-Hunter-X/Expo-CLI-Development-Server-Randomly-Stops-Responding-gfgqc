# Expo CLI Development Server Intermittently Stops Responding

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered with the Expo CLI development server where it randomly stops responding, resulting in a blank screen in the Expo Go app.  No error messages are provided to aid in debugging.

## Problem

The development server becomes unresponsive, displaying a blank screen in the Expo Go app.  Restarting the server using `expo start --reset` provides a temporary solution, but the issue reoccurs intermittently.

## Solution (See expoBugSolution.js)

While no definitive root cause has been found for this specific erratic behavior, the solution presented in `expoBugSolution.js` explores common contributing factors and provides mitigation strategies such as clearing cache, checking network connectivity, upgrading dependencies, and examining app logic for potential memory leaks or infinite loops.  The focus is on enhancing the stability and robustness of the development environment.
