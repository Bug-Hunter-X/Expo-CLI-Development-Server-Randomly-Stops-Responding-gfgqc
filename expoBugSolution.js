The provided solution focuses on addressing potential contributing factors rather than a single definitive fix for this unpredictable bug.  It involves several checks to ensure your development environment and application code are not causing this intermittent issue:

1. **Clear the cache:**  Run `expo start --clear` to clear the cache and ensure a fresh start.
2. **Check network connectivity:** Verify a stable internet connection.  Intermittent network issues can cause the development server to become unresponsive.
3. **Update Expo CLI and dependencies:**  Ensure you're using the latest versions of Expo CLI and all your project dependencies using `expo upgrade` and `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. **Examine app logic:**  Review your application code for potential issues like infinite loops, memory leaks, or long-running operations that might freeze the development server.
5. **Restart your computer or device:**  Sometimes, a system-level restart can resolve underlying issues affecting the development environment.
6. **Reduce the size of your assets:** Large images or other assets might slow down the performance. Consider compressing your images before loading them into your application.

By performing these checks, you are likely to improve the stability of your Expo development server, greatly reducing the occurrence of the blank screen error.  If the issue persists despite these steps, consider searching for other solutions relevant to your particular environment and application.
